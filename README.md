# Apple Detection with YOLOv8

This repository contains an apple detection project using YOLOv8 segmentation. The model is trained on a custom dataset and uses the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework for instance segmentation.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install dependencies manually:

```sh
pip install opencv-python==4.8.0.76 ultralytics==8.0.20 google-colab==1.0.0
```

## Training the Model
1. **Mount Google Drive**: Store your dataset in Google Drive and mount it in Colab:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```
2. **Extract the dataset**:
    ```python
    import zipfile, os
    zip_file_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Appel/Appledetect.v4i.yolov8.zip"
    extracted_dir_path = "/content/extracted"
    os.makedirs(extracted_dir_path, exist_ok=True)
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall(extracted_dir_path)
    ```
3. **Train the YOLOv8 model**:
    ```sh
    yolo task=segment mode=train model=yolov8x-seg.pt data=/content/extracted/data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640 plots=True
    ```

## Saving Training Results
After training, save the results to Google Drive:
```python
import shutil
source_path = "/content/extracted/runs/segment/train"
destination_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Appel/train"
shutil.copytree(source_path, destination_path, dirs_exist_ok=True)
print("Training results copied successfully.")
```

## Usage
- Modify `data.yaml` to specify the correct dataset paths.
- Train for more epochs or use different models (`yolov8m-seg.pt`, `yolov8l-seg.pt`) for better results.
